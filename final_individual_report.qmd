## Introduction

As a neurodivergent student who attended New York public schools, I experienced firsthand how the presence of guidance counselors and school psychologists made the critical difference between academic success and failure. These support services were not merely helpful—they were essential to my ability to navigate the educational system and achieve any level of academic success. This personal experience immediately drew me to examine the available data on resource allocation for these vital services across New York's school districts when my group began exploring the broader topic of public school funding. While substantial research has explored the relationship between overall school funding and student outcomes, less attention has been paid to how specific allocation decisions—particularly the proportion of budgets dedicated to support services—influence academic achievement. This report investigates a question close to my heart: How does the proportional funding level of Student and Staff Support Services affect student success in New York State school districts? Through this analysis, I seek to understand whether the effectiveness of support services spending depends on the overall funding context of school districts, with the hope of illuminating how these critical resources that made such a difference in my own education impact.

## Data Acquisition and Processing

### Overview

This analysis required integrating two primary data sources: district-level financial data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and graduation outcome data from the New York State Education Department (NYSED). The data acquisition and processing workflow involved four sequential steps to create a unified dataset suitable for examining relationships between school district funding and student outcomes in New York State.

### Data Sources

#### NCES District Finance Data

The financial data was obtained from the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) School District Finance Survey (F-33). This dataset provides comprehensive district-level financial information including total revenues, expenditures, and per-pupil spending metrics. The data was accessed through the NCES CCD download portal at https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp, specifically targeting the most recent fiscal year data (FY 2024).

The NCES dataset was filtered to include only New York State districts by subsetting records where the STATE field equals New York's FIPS code (36). This preprocessing step ensured alignment with the geographic scope of the graduation data and reduced computational overhead for subsequent analysis steps.

#### NYSED Graduation Rate Data

Student outcome data was sourced from the New York State Education Department's Graduation Rate Database, specifically the 2024 Graduation Rate data file (2024_GRADUATION_RATE.mdp). This comprehensive database tracks cohort-based graduation outcomes for all public school districts in New York State, providing detailed metrics on student completion and persistence.

The NYSED Graduation Rate data follows the 2020 Total Cohort 4-Year Outcome methodology, which tracks students from their initial entry into 9th grade through their expected graduation date four years later. The database includes multiple outcome categories: traditional graduation rates, local diploma recipients, Regents diploma recipients (both standard and advanced), non-diploma credentials, students still enrolled, GED recipients, and dropout counts. This cohort-based approach provides a complete accounting of all students, ensuring that every student in the original cohort is tracked to one of these outcomes.

### Data Processing Challenges and Solutions

#### Legacy Database Format Conversion

A significant technical challenge emerged from NYSED's use of legacy Microsoft Access database format (.mdp/.mdb files) for their Graduation Rate data. These proprietary formats are not natively readable by modern data analysis environments, particularly on macOS systems without Microsoft Access installations.

After extensive troubleshooting with Homebrew installations and compilation errors, a Docker-based solution emerged as the most reliable approach. The conversion process utilized Docker containerization with pre-built mdbtools utilities to extract tabular data from the Access database files:

```bash
# Docker-based MDB file conversion commands
# Navigate to the folder containing the database
cd "/Users/mcg219/Documents/STA9750"

# List all table names in the MDB file
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work scottcame/mdbtools \
  mdb-tables -1 /work/2024_GRADUATION_RATE.mdp

# Export the GRAD_DATA table to CSV format
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work scottcame/mdbtools \
  mdb-export /work/2024_GRADUATION_RATE.mdp "GRAD_DATA" > GRAD_DATA.csv
```

This approach avoided system-level software installations, eliminated dependency conflicts, and maintained reproducibility across different operating environments. The implementation involved using lightweight Docker containers to execute mdbtools commands, with the database files mounted as volumes. Each table was systematically extracted and exported directly to CSV format using command-line utilities, enabling seamless integration with standard data processing workflows.

#### Data Structure Harmonization

The NYSED Graduation Rate database required substantial filtering and restructuring due to its comprehensive nature. The database contains graduation outcomes at multiple aggregation levels (state, county, district, school) and tracks numerous demographic subgroups. For this analysis, district-level records were isolated by filtering for aggregation_type == "District", focusing specifically on the "2020 Total Cohort - 4 Year Outcome" cohort and "All Students" subgroup to ensure consistency across districts. This approach provides district-wide metrics that align with the district-level financial data from NCES.

### Dataset Integration

Integration of the NCES financial data with NYSED Graduation Rate data presented matching challenges due to inconsistencies in district naming conventions between the two systems. A fuzzy matching approach was implemented using standardized district names, where both datasets were processed to create lowercase, whitespace-trimmed matching keys.

The integration process was implemented using R with specialized libraries for Excel file handling and data manipulation:

```r
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(writexl)

# File paths
NCES_FILE <- "ncesdata_9713EF8D.xlsx"
GRAD_FILE <- "GRADRATE_excel.xlsx"  # The converted Graduation Rate data
GRAD_SHEET <- "2024_GRADUATION_RATE"
OUT_CSV <- "districts_grad_2020_byname_R.csv"
OUT_XLSX <- "districts_grad_2020_byname_R.xlsx"

# Define metrics to extract from graduation data
METRICS <- c(
  "enroll_cnt", "grad_cnt", "grad_pct",
  "local_cnt", "local_pct",
  "reg_cnt", "reg_pct",
  "reg_adv_cnt", "reg_adv_pct",
  "non_diploma_credential_cnt", "non_diploma_credential_pct",
  "still_enr_cnt", "still_enr_pct",
  "ged_cnt", "ged_pct",
  "dropout_cnt", "dropout_pct"
)

GRAD_COLS <- c("aggregation_type", "membership_desc", "subgroup_name",
               "aggregation_name", METRICS)

# Read NCES financial data
nces <- read_excel(NCES_FILE, col_types = "text") %>%
  rename(district_id = LEAID,
         district_name = DistrictName) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(district_key = tolower(trimws(district_name)))

# Read NYSED Graduation Rate data
grad <- read_excel(GRAD_FILE,
                   sheet = GRAD_SHEET,
                   col_types = "text") %>%
  select(all_of(GRAD_COLS))

# Filter to district-level data for 2020 cohort
grad_filtered <- grad %>%
  filter(aggregation_type == "District",
         membership_desc == "2020 Total Cohort - 4 Year Outcome",
         subgroup_name == "All Students") %>%
  distinct(aggregation_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(district_key = tolower(trimws(aggregation_name))) %>%
  select(district_key, all_of(METRICS))

# Merge datasets on standardized district names
merged <- nces %>%
  left_join(grad_filtered, by = "district_key") %>%
  select(-district_key) %>%
  arrange(district_name)

# Save integrated dataset
write.csv(merged, OUT_CSV, row.names = FALSE)
write_xlsx(merged, OUT_XLSX)

cat("✓ Wrote", OUT_CSV, "and", OUT_XLSX, 
    paste0("(", nrow(merged), " districts, ", ncol(merged), " columns).\n"))
```

The merging process included several quality control measures to ensure data integrity. Duplicate district records were identified and removed from both datasets prior to joining. The final merged dataset was validated by examining match rates and identifying any districts present in one dataset but missing from the other. This integrated dataset provides the foundation for our analysis, combining financial metrics with graduation outcomes for each New York State school district.

## Analysis: Student Support Services and Academic Achievement

### Understanding the Funding Landscape

To address how proportional funding levels of Student and Staff Support Services affect student success, we must first understand the broader educational funding context. School districts operate within dramatically different resource environments, creating the foundation for our investigation.

#### Data Preparation and Variable Construction

Before exploring the relationships between funding and outcomes, we need to prepare our integrated dataset for analysis. This involves converting financial variables to appropriate numeric formats, extracting percentage values from text fields, calculating our key independent variable (support services as a proportion of total budget), and creating our composite outcome measure (weighted Regents score). Additionally, we remove outlier districts to ensure our findings aren't driven by extreme cases.

```{r data-prep}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
library(viridis)
library(corrplot)
library(patchwork)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)

# Set up output directory
if (!dir.exists("output")) {
  dir.create("output")
}

# Read the CSV file
df <- read.csv("districts_grad_2020_byname.csv")

# DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
df_clean <- df %>%
  mutate(
    # Convert financial columns to numeric
    StudentandStaffSupportPerStudent = as.numeric(as.character(StudentandStaffSupportPerStudent)),
    TotalCurrentExpendituresPerStudent = as.numeric(as.character(TotalCurrentExpendituresPerStudent)),
    InstructionalExpendituresPerStudent = as.numeric(as.character(InstructionalExpendituresPerStudent)),
    AdministrationPerStudent = as.numeric(as.character(AdministrationPerStudent)),
    OperationsPerStudent = as.numeric(as.character(OperationsPerStudent)),
    
    # Clean percentage columns
    grad_pct_num = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", grad_pct)),
    reg_pct_num = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", reg_pct)),
    reg_adv_pct_num = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", reg_adv_pct)),
    non_diploma_credential_pct_num = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", non_diploma_credential_pct)),
    dropout_pct_num = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", dropout_pct)),
    
    # Calculate support services as proportion of total budget
    SupportProportion = StudentandStaffSupportPerStudent / TotalCurrentExpendituresPerStudent * 100
  ) %>%
  # Filter out rows with missing key values - MUST have both reg_pct and reg_adv_pct
  filter(!is.na(reg_pct_num) & !is.na(reg_adv_pct_num) & 
           !is.na(SupportProportion) & !is.na(TotalCurrentExpendituresPerStudent))

# Remove outliers (5% at each end of support proportion) - do this BEFORE creating other variables
q_low <- quantile(df_clean$SupportProportion, 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
q_high <- quantile(df_clean$SupportProportion, 0.95, na.rm = TRUE)
df_clean <- df_clean %>% 
  filter(SupportProportion >= q_low & SupportProportion <= q_high)

# NOW create the weighted score after filtering
df_clean <- df_clean %>%
  mutate(WeightedRegentsScore = reg_pct_num + (2 * reg_adv_pct_num))
```

```{r chart-1}
# CHART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDING LANDSCAPE

  geom_histogram(fill = "#3498db", alpha = 0.8, bins = 30) +

  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

# Combine and save
funding_landscape <- p1a + p1b
ggsave("output/01_funding_landscape.png", funding_landscape, width = 12, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-funding-landscape
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of total spending and support services spending across NY districts"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("output/01_funding_landscape.png")
```

The distribution of both total expenditures and support services spending reveals significant variation across districts. Total spending per student ranges widely, with most districts clustered around the median but substantial outliers extending the distribution. Similarly, support services spending shows considerable variation, suggesting that districts make different strategic choices about resource allocation even within similar funding contexts.

### Defining Academic Success

Before examining the relationship between support services and outcomes, we must establish which success metrics best capture student achievement. Multiple indicators exist, each measuring different aspects of educational effectiveness.

```{r chart-2}
# CHART 2: CORRELATION MATRIX - DEFINING SUCCESS METRICS

# Select outcome variables for correlation matrix
outcome_vars <- df_clean %>%
  select(grad_pct_num, reg_pct_num, reg_adv_pct_num, 
         WeightedRegentsScore, dropout_pct_num) %>%
  rename(
    "Graduation Rate" = grad_pct_num,
    "Regents Diploma" = reg_pct_num,
    "Advanced Regents" = reg_adv_pct_num,
    "Weighted Regents Score" = WeightedRegentsScore,
    "Dropout Rate" = dropout_pct_num
  )

# Calculate correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(outcome_vars, use = "complete.obs")

# Create correlation plot
png("output/02_correlation_matrix.png", width = 8, height = 8, units = "in", res = 300)
corrplot(cor_matrix, 
         method = "color",
         type = "upper",
         order = "hclust",
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.srt = 45,
         addCoef.col = "black",
         number.cex = 0.8,
         col = colorRampPalette(c("#E74C3C", "white", "#3498DB"))(100),
         title = "Correlation Between Student Success Metrics",
         mar = c(0,0,2,0))
dev.off()
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-correlation
#| fig-cap: "Correlation matrix of student success metrics"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("output/02_correlation_matrix.png")
```

The correlation analysis reveals strong relationships between key success metrics. Graduation rates show moderate positive correlations with Regents performance (0.47-0.71), while dropout rates demonstrate strong negative correlations with academic achievement (-0.78 with graduation rates). The weighted Regents score, which combines regular and advanced Regents performance, emerges as a comprehensive measure that captures both breadth and depth of student achievement, making it our primary outcome variable.

### Initial Relationship Exploration

With our success metric established, we can examine the fundamental question: does support services spending relate to academic achievement?

```{r chart-3}
# CHART 3: INITIAL RELATIONSHIP EXPLORATION

# Simple scatter plot of support spending vs. weighted Regents scores
p3 <- ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = StudentandStaffSupportPerStudent, y = WeightedRegentsScore)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "#2c3e50") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#e74c3c", se = TRUE) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "Support Services Spending vs. Academic Achievement",
       subtitle = "Each point represents one district",
       x = "Support Services Per Student ($)",
       y = "Weighted Regents Score") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

ggsave("output/03_initial_relationship.png", p3, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-initial-relationship
#| fig-cap: "Basic relationship between support services spending and academic achievement"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("output/03_initial_relationship.png")
```

The basic relationship appears positive but modest. Support services spending shows a slight upward trend with weighted Regents scores, but the relationship is not strongly linear. The wide scatter of points suggests that absolute dollar amounts may not tell the complete story. This observation leads to a critical question: does proportional allocation matter more than absolute spending?

### The Proportional Spending Question

Rather than focusing solely on dollar amounts, examining support services as a percentage of total budget may reveal different patterns.

```{r chart-4}
# CHART 4: PROPORTIONAL SPENDING QUESTION

# Scatter plot showing support services as % of total budget vs. outcomes
p4 <- ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = SupportProportion, y = WeightedRegentsScore)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "#27ae60") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#e74c3c", se = TRUE) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, "%")) +
  labs(title = "Does Proportional Allocation Matter More Than Absolute Dollars?",
       subtitle = "Support services as percentage of total budget vs. academic achievement",
       x = "Support Services (% of Total Budget)",
       y = "Weighted Regents Score") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

ggsave("output/04_proportional_spending.png", p4, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-proportional
#| fig-cap: "Support services as percentage of total budget vs. academic achievement"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("output/04_proportional_spending.png")
```

When viewed proportionally, the relationship between support services allocation and academic achievement becomes even less clear. This suggests that neither absolute dollars nor simple proportional measures adequately explain the relationship. The wide variation in outcomes at similar support percentages indicates that context matters significantly.

### The Role of Overall Funding Levels

The complexity observed in earlier analyses suggests that overall district wealth may influence how effectively support services translate into improved outcomes.

```{r chart-5}
# CHART 5: FUNDING CONTEXT MATTERS

# Create funding quartiles
df_with_quartiles <- df_clean %>%
  mutate(FundingQuartile = ntile(TotalCurrentExpendituresPerStudent, 4))

# Box plots of outcomes by funding quartile
p5 <- ggplot(df_with_quartiles, aes(x = factor(FundingQuartile), y = WeightedRegentsScore)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(FundingQuartile)), alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "C", name = "Funding Quartile") +
  labs(title = "Do Wealthier Districts Automatically Have Better Outcomes?",
       subtitle = "Academic achievement by overall funding level",
       x = "Funding Quartile (1 = Lowest, 4 = Highest)",
       y = "Weighted Regents Score") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "none")

ggsave("output/05_funding_context.png", p5, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-funding-quartiles
#| fig-cap: "Academic achievement by overall funding quartile"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("output/05_funding_context.png")
```

Districts in higher funding quartiles do show generally better academic outcomes, but the relationship is not straightforward. While the highest-funded districts (Q4) show the best median performance, the improvement is not strictly linear across quartiles. This pattern suggests that the relationship between resources and outcomes involves threshold effects rather than simple linear scaling.

### Uncovering the Interaction Effect

The key insight emerges when we examine how support services effectiveness varies by overall funding context.

```{r chart-6}
# CHART 6: INTERACTION EFFECT HYPOTHESIS

# Create side-by-side scatter plots for low vs high funded districts
low_funded <- df_with_quartiles %>% filter(FundingQuartile == 1)

       x = "Support Services (% of Budget)",
       y = "Weighted Regents Score") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11)

p6b <- ggplot(high_funded, aes(x = SupportProportion, y = WeightedRegentsScore)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "#3498db") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = TRUE) +

                                                  use = "complete.obs"), 3)),
       x = "Support Services (% of Budget)",
       y = "Weighted Regents Score") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 11)

interaction_plot <- p6a + p6b
ggsave("output/06_interaction_hypothesis.png", interaction_plot, width = 12, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-interaction
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of support services effectiveness in low vs. high funded districts"
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("output/06_interaction_hypothesis.png")
```

Comparing the lowest-funded (Q1) and highest-funded (Q4) districts reveals dramatically different relationships. In Q1 districts, support services show minimal correlation with outcomes (0.026), suggesting that basic resource constraints may limit effectiveness. However, in Q4 districts, the correlation strengthens considerably (0.158), indicating that adequate overall funding enables support services to drive meaningful improvements.

### The Complete Picture: Context-Dependent Effectiveness

The full complexity of the relationship becomes clear when examining all funding levels simultaneously and their interaction with support services allocation.

```

This analysis reveals the critical finding: support services effectiveness depends entirely on funding context. In Q1 districts (lowest funded), moving from lowest to highest support allocation yields a 4.86-point improvement in weighted Regents scores—a 3.82% gain. Q2 and Q3 districts show minimal responsiveness, with improvements of just 1.84 and 0.17 points respectively. However, Q4 districts (highest funded) demonstrate the most dramatic response: a 13.77-point improvement (11.19% gain) when prioritizing support services.

### Identifying Threshold Effects

The non-linear nature of support services effectiveness becomes even more apparent when examining achievement levels across the full spectrum of support allocation.

```{r chart-8}
# CHART 8 THRESHOLD EFFECTS VISUALIZATION

# Bin support proportion to identify thresholds
df_threshold <- df_clean %>%
  mutate(SupportBin = cut(SupportProportion, 
                          breaks = seq(floor(min(SupportProportion)), 
                                       ceiling(max(SupportProportion)) + 0.5, 
                                       by = 0.5),
                          labels = FALSE))

# Calculate averages by bin
threshold_data <- df_threshold %>%
  group_by(SupportBin) %>%
  summarize(
    support_pct = mean(SupportProportion),
    avg_score = mean(WeightedRegentsScore),
    n = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  filter(n >= 5)  # Only bins with at least 5 districts

p_bonus <- ggplot(threshold_data, aes(x = support_pct, y = avg_score)) +
  geom_line(color = "#e74c3c", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(aes(size = n), color = "#e74c3c") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE, alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, "%")) +
  labs(title = "Identifying Threshold Effects in Support Services",
       subtitle = "Average achievement at different support funding levels",
       x = "Support Services (% of Total Budget)",
       y = "Average Weighted Regents Score",
       size = "Number of\nDistricts") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

ggsave("output/bonus_threshold_effects.png", p_bonus, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-threshold
#| fig-cap: "Threshold effects in support services allocation"
#| echo: false

```

The relationship shows clear threshold effects rather than linear improvement. Achievement increases gradually until approximately 8% support allocation, remains relatively flat through the middle range, then shows sharp improvements at higher allocation levels. This pattern suggests that support services may need to reach critical mass before generating substantial benefits.

## Key Implications

The analysis reveals three distinct patterns that fundamentally reshape our understanding of support services effectiveness:

**Resource-Constrained Districts (Q1):** In the lowest-funded districts, every dollar allocated to support services generates measurable improvements. These districts likely face critical gaps in basic student support infrastructure—counseling, intervention programs, wraparound services—that support funding directly addresses. The 3.82% improvement represents meaningful gains for districts operating with limited resources.

**Middle-Funded Districts (Q2-Q3):** These districts show minimal responsiveness to support services allocation, suggesting they may have sufficient baseline resources to meet basic student needs. Additional support allocation may yield diminishing returns when fundamental infrastructure is already adequate but not exceptional.

**Well-Resourced Districts (Q4):** The most dramatic responsiveness occurs in highest-funded districts, where comprehensive support services can push achievement to exceptional levels. The 11.19% improvement suggests that when combined with adequate instructional resources, support services create multiplicative rather than additive effects.

## Conclusion

The relationship between support services funding and student achievement is not simply linear but depends critically on overall resource context. Support services appear most essential in resource-constrained environments, where they fill critical gaps, and most transformative in well-resourced environments, where they enable districts to achieve exceptional outcomes. This finding has profound implications for education policy, suggesting that support services allocation strategies must be tailored to districts' overall funding contexts to maximize effectiveness. Policymakers should consider differentiated approaches that recognize these context-dependent effects rather than applying uniform allocation formulas across all districts.
